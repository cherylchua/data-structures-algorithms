## Stable vs Unstable Sort
- Unstable Sort: Relative ordering of duplicate items is not preserved
- Stable Sort: Relative ordering of duplicate items is preserved

Note: Stable Sorts are preferred especially when sorting objects on multiple fields

### Stable Sorts
- Bubble Sort (because we are sorting based on `j < i` as opposed to `j <= i`)
